          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>
            When you are in your sleeping quarters, you can be yourself. But in
            the common spaces, it is never polite to look at others. They might
            not appreciate being looked at, or they might not like it. It is not
            considered wrong to want to look at other, but it is wrong to
            actually look at them. We have the sin, not the sinner.
          </p>
          <p>
            One good example of a place where you don't want to look at others:
            the bathrooms. Thy are nice and toasty, so that people don't get
            cold. They smell like soap and they are always clean because you
            clean them. Bathrooms are for privacy. Do not look at people in
            bathrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In kitchens, you make your food. You are allowed to talk to others,
            if they want to talk. As long as you don't look.
          </p>
          <p>Subjects to avoid whn talking to people:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inflammatory subjects</li>
            <li>The topic of religion or Atheism</li>
            <li>
              Music, forbidden music (no music is forbidden, except loud music.)
            </li>
            <li>Preferring cats or dogs</li>
            <li>Things you remember which are nostalgia</li>
            <li>Ghosts</li>
            <li>Things you do outside the Prime Living Space</li>
            <li>Your role or function</li>
            <li>How much you pay for things (rent+)</li>
            <li>How much you get paid for chores</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Do not knock on any doors, especially door which have colors on the
            south-east end of the color wheel. If it's an emergency, you can
            knock on a white door. If there is not white door anywhere you can
            king, then you can knock on a door from any of the three other
            quarters of the color wheel. This you must remember ant not break
            the rule.

          <marquee direction="right">
            <h2>Windows</h2>
          </marquee>
          <p>
            There are no windows that look out to the outside of the Prime
            Living Space. If you see a window-like object, that a one-way
            mirror. If you can see your reflection, that means that you are on
            the non-see-through side of the one-way mirror. If you can see a
            room or a corridor, that means people from the other side cannot see
            you. You can use this time to look at them. Also, be aware that any
            time you can see a mirror-side of the window, somebody may be
            looking at you. You can do what you want with that knowledge, but we
            trust you will remember about the principles and the rules.
          </p>
          <h2>Staff</h2>
          <p>
            Staff will not speak to you or look at you, no matter what you do.
            That does not mean you will not be punished for breaking the rules.
            You punishment will come at the hand of a super, and it will come at
            the appropriate moment. You will not know when the time comes, so be
            ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are in the midst of being punished, but you feel like you did
            not do anything and you do not deserve it, remember about these
            simple things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be ready</li>
            <li>You probably don't remember</li>
            <li>
              Maybe you didn't know you were breaking the rules. That's okay,
              that does not mean you will not be punished.
            </li>
            <li>You look like somebody else</li>
            <li>Sometimes mistakes are made</li>
            <li>Be ready</li>
            <li>Be ready</li>
            <li>Be ready</li>
            <li>Be ready</li>
            <li>Be ready</li>
            <li>Be ready</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Door locks</h2>
          <p>
            There are door locks, but residents are not given keys. If a door is
            locked, you cannot cross it until a member of staff unlocks it. Do
            not ask for a door to be unlocked, that is not polite.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find yourself behind a locked door in a single room with no
            other exit, for example a small sleeping space, you cannot leave
            until a member of the staff has unlocked the door. Do not knock on
            the door and say "Hello?", or "Is anybody there?". Nobody wants to
            hear that. The staff must have had a good reason to lock the door
            and they will unlock it when appropriate.
          </p>
          <h2>Lights out!</h2>
          <p>
            If the lights are out, that means it's time to take a nap. If you
            are near a sleeping space, go there, take up an empty bed. If there
            are no empty beds there, don't leave and try to look for another
            one, lay on the floor. If you are far from a sleeping space, just
            lay down where you are. It's okay to not feel sleepy, just shut your
            eyes and don't open them until you can see the light through your
            eyelids.
          </p>
          <h2>Dish washing</h2>
          <p>
            Do not leave dirty plates in the sink. If you're done with a plate,
            wash it. If there's no detergent, or no sponge, or the sponge is
            "yucky", don't worry, if you are more entrepreneurial, you would be
            living in a better place. Instead of whining, wash the plate in warm
            water. If there's no warm water, use cold water. If there's no
            water, use your tongue.
          </p>
          <h2>Food</h2>
          <p>
            If you are hungry, eat. Do not use any of the food in the cupboards
            or fridges, unless you put it there. This food is not free for the
            taking. Bring your food. If you don't have money for food, make
            money.
